# My Second Todo List

I have created a second todo-list using javascript, html and css.
It enables one to enter your todo items and manage it. It has 3 parts one for all the todos one for completed todos and last for uncompleted todos. you can manage it fromm the drop down .


Enter the todo. and click on plus or hit enter. You will see your todo list. You can click on thi green tick to know that you have completed the work and also click on trash to delete the todo.


Also this list is also storage in the local storage(press f12 (or inspect the page) and go to local storage option in the application tab). So even your browser gets close , the list is saved here.
